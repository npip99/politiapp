    title: "Florida Senator Lauren Book files bill that outlaws the declawing of cats",
    date: "January 9th, 2020",

    Approximately 20-25% of cats in the US are declawed. However, there has been recent outcry due to the perception that such declawings are both painful and unnatural. It's currently illegal in Australia, and most of the EU. However, it remains legal throughout the US except for select municipalities such as Hollywood, California. Around 50-60% of Americans responded "yes" when asked if they believed declawing was an acceptable practice.

    Veternarians will in cases support declawing in situations where a family member is immuno-comprimised and could be at risk of infection or sickness if cut. Veternarians in many cases support declawing as a last-resort, when the only other option is abandoning the cat. Overall, there is increasing debate and outcry for the routine use of cat declawing for reasons such as saving furniture.

    Florida Senator Lauren of Broward County has filed a bill outlawing cat declawing for any reason other than therapeutic purposes. The penalty stands at $1,000 per infraction. Many would consider this a win for cat owners and cat protectants. However, a case is to be made where this law is too invasive into the personal desires of a cat owner. For example, declawing for the protection of an immuno-comprimised family member is outlawed under this bill, despite overall consensus that such a reason is justifiable. This bill can be perceived as too overbearing as it outlaws it for any human-related need, while the outcry is focused on declawing for unjustifiable reasons such as not having to file a cats nails anymore.

    title: "Governor DeSantis supports California's Fair Pay to Play Act",

    The NCAA has a long-standing ban on college football players receiving advertising compensation. For example, it is against the NCAA rules for a player to host their own YouTube channel, and use their own name and likeness for ad revenue.

    California changed this by passing the Fair Pay to Play Act on September 30th, 2019. This bypasses the NCAA's rules by giving all college football players the right to collect ad revenues and hire their own personal advertising agents. Mark Emmert, the NCAA president, threatened to ban California from the NCAA if they continued with the ruling. Having passed the law, it appears the NCAA has made no reaction in the wake of it.

    With other states looking to pass their own version of this law, Florida legislation has moved forward in pursuing this. Florida representatives Kionne McGhee of Miami-Dade and Chip Lamarca of Lighthouse Point have since filed bills into the house legislature that mimic California's Fair Pay to Play Act. Shortly after, Florida Governor DeSantis has come out and voiced support both for Califonia's decision and for Kionne McGhee's and Chip Lamarca's proposal.
